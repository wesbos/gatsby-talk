        h1 Tips

      article
        h1 Everything must go through Gatsby.
        p One of the biggest Hurdles is thinking in terms of gatsby.

      article
        h3 Where do I put my images?
        p You don't. You import them into your template. This way Gatsby is aware of them and can compress them
      article
        h3 Where do I link stylesheets?
        p You don't. You import them into your template. This way Gatsby can compute critical css.

      article
        h3 Where do I fetch data?
        p You source the data into Gatsby first. This way you can statically render it, and re-render only the templates needed because Gatsby knows where that data was used.

      article
        h3 You get the point
        p If Gatsby is aware of every single image, asset, CSS style and node of data, it's able to do all the amazing things we talked about earlier.
